# Overview

Gamer Connect is a web application that helps UH students discover and connect with other gamers on campus based on their favorite games, skill levels, gaming goals (casual play, ranked competition, streaming, etc.), and availability. By creating detailed gamer profiles, students can find like-minded players to form teams, join communities, or just find new friends to play with.

### Home Page

The home page is where users are directed to right after logging in. The page gives the users a central hub to quickly view current or upcoming events, and another tab to search for other players.

### Profile Page

After clicking the profile button in the navbar, users will be directed to their own personalized profile. Users may customize their profile and add relevant game tags/interests.

### Player Search Page

The player search page will allow users to not only search by name, but also to receive a quick overview of other users with relevant filters/tags
